Please perform a comprehensive analysis of my Flight Deal Finder project. Follow these steps:

1. Examine the project structure:
   - List all directories and subdirectories
   - Identify all Python files (.py) and their locations
   - Note any configuration files (e.g., .env, requirements.txt)
   - Locate and read the README.md file

2. For each Python file:
   - Analyze the imports to understand dependencies
   - Identify the main classes and functions
   - Summarize the purpose of each file
   - Note any TODO comments or areas marked for improvement

3. Pay special attention to:
   - main.py: The entry point of the application
   - pages/google_sheet.py: Interaction with Google Sheets
   - pages/flight_api.py: Flight search functionality
   - utils/email_sender.py: Email notification system

4. Examine the README.md:
   - Note the project description, features, and setup instructions
   - Identify any discrepancies between the README and the actual code

5. Check the requirements.txt file:
   - List all dependencies and their versions

6. Look for any configuration or environment variables:
   - Identify where API keys and sensitive information are stored
   - Note how these are accessed in the code

7. Analyze the overall application flow:
   - Understand how the different components interact
   - Identify any potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization

9. Based on this analysis:
   - Suggest the best approach to implement the requested change
   - Identify any other parts of the code that might need modification to accommodate this change
   - Propose any additional improvements or features that could enhance the project

Please provide a detailed report of your findings and recommendations based on this analysis. This will help ensure that you have an up-to-date and comprehensive understanding of the project before we proceed with implementing the changes.
